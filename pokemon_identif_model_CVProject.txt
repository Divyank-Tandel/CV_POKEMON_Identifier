Pokemon identification -
input random pokemon
model train on label pokemon dataset (initially few then keep on adding)
(get his colour , his structure , his pattern od body)
output - its name


DATASET -(pikachu,Minun,Plusle,option-(chimchar))-
1- images of pokemon - 500 each with same pixel size eg.512x512 , 256x256 JPG formate
2- label them with folder

(if there is no enough images , we create roated , fliped images to incrase dataset, what we call it ?)

Minun - Pokemon Journeys - episode - 61 , pokemon advanced - episode - 38 - done 26 images
Plusle - Pokemon Journeys - episode - 61 , pokemon advanced - episode - 38 - done 26 images
Pikachu - done 26 images

task -1) make every sample of fix dimensions pixel x pixel - 384x384(avg is 420) - we cant get proper image with 384-changing to 400
      2) data augmentation ? (duplicate images with rotation or with different angle)
	3) model trained done
	4) SimpleCNN Done


If want to try we can do more methods just in case 
Note - add 1 more pokemon with yellow color
